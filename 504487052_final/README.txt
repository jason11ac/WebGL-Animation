He decides to go on a walk and finds a river that is too large to cross. Just as he is starting to get sad about cutting his walk short, God appears in Adam’s world and helps Adam get across the river by creating a bridge of rocks. Adam then proceeds to cross the bridge safely. The animation begins by looking at Adam’s heart, in his body. Then the camera pans out and watches Adam reach the river. Then the camera looks at God, who is flying across the river from Adam. As Adam and God have a conversation, the camera goes back and forth between them. Then we watch Adam cross the bridge over the river. Dialogue and instructions for how to navigate the story are shown with text in the animation. Adam:Adam is made up of a hierarchy of different objects. His torso/center is the base object that the rest all build off of. His shirt has a shirt texture as well.God: God is made up of a hierarchy of different rotating objects. The orange sphere in the center is the base object and there are multiple rotational matrices that allow the different shapes to rotate around the center sphere in different ways. The transparent blue diamonds rotating around the outer 4 cubes are my custom shape.Custom Shape:My custom shape is a 3D diamond made up of multiple triangles. Two triangles make the center square, while 8 triangles make the diamond shape, with 4 on each side of the square. I didn’t put any texture on the diamonds in my animation, but the shape’s texture coordinates are all set up for doing this successfully. 

I also created a Rectangular prism shape called Rect_Prism, which takes 3 parameters as 
x, y and z dimensions.
